      Homework Assignment 3  
    </h1>

    <p>
        This is a very easy assignment.
    </p>
    <p>
        You start by making your html and css file.
    </p>
    <p>
        Then you link your css file to your html.
    </p>
    <p>
        In your css file you create a tag called 
        @font-face and use src: url to link your 
        font file to css and use font-family to give  it a name.
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally you create another css tag such as body and use font-family to assign the font to your website.
