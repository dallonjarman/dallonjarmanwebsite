            social networking sites such as Twitter, MySpace, and Facebook, Orkut which has made the social 
            media a vital aspect of their life. Social network is transforming the behavior in which youthful 
            people relate with their parents, peers, as well as how they make use of technology. The effects of

            I did this one paragraph at a time. It took a while and a lot of lines of 
            code mainly for the big bodies of text. I used many tags. The most common being the p tags. There were 
            many instances where a unordered list was needed. Most of this project I was able to complete from proir 
            knowledge of HTML and required very few google searching for how to format this file.
